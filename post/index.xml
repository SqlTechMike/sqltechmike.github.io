      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, but I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that it&amp;rsquo;s time to make a return to active blogging. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the occasional post through my employer&amp;rsquo;s blogging platform, but I need to get better about blogging consistently and I wanted to have a forum that was mine.
My goal is to treat this blog as an archive of thoughts and experiences as I encounter new challenges in my professional career. I hope that they provide value, and perhaps even entertainment, to you as a reader.</description>
